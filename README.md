# Frink

Basic ORM-like functionality for RethinkDB on top of Schematics. Built specifically for use with Flask and includes datastore classes for [Flask-Security](https://github.com/mattupstate/flask-security).

**WARNING**: This is totally pre-alpha at the moment. Things are likely to change. If you're interested in using it in production, then contributions to get it somewhere stable would be much appreciated.

## Usage

Don't use it yet.

## Installation

Don't install it yet.

## Requirements

Requires the excellent [schematics](https://github.com/schematics/schematics), the [rethinkdb](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rethinkdb/) driver, and inflection.

## Compatibility

Python 2 only at the moment, because who uses Python 3 with Flask?
